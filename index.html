<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am a recent graduate of Skidmore College, who enjoys teaching, music, wildlife photography, and game development. At Skidmore, I studied Computer Science, with a minor in Religious Studies. Computer Science is a natural fit for me, as I had been curious about the technology around the house from a young age. I liked to play with toy computers and peer into the VCR. Then, I started programming small video games in the Scratch programming language. In college, I was initially considering the pre-medical track, but I felt it was best to explore my options a bit more, and soon enough I was learning Java and Python. <br><br>Toward the end of college I took a part time job teaching. I found it to be stressful at times, but enjoyable overall. It is wonderful to students people gain confidence in their abilities. As of today, I have taught children from ages of 5 - 15 in elementary programming, theater, comedy, and drama. Children are funny and chaotic people, but when you do finally get their attention it is a joy to see them learn about things they love.<br><br>I also dabble with pixel art, chiptune music, and esoteric programming language development. Such skills are needed for game development!
